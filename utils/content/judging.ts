          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "Neural Prism v6.8.5 is built exclusively on a sovereign Google Gemini orchestration pipeline. We treat diverse Gemini models as specialized logic gates. For high-dimensional typesetting and 24-section book synthesis, we leverage gemini-3-pro-preview. For the sub-800ms heuristic simulation in Builder Studio, we route tasks to gemini-3-flash-preview with a zero-token thinking budget." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "How is the real-time voice handled if it's all Gemini?" },
          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "Excellent question. Let's look at the live log trace. When your prompt enters our Complexity Balancer, it identifies the intent instantly. If the intent is 'Reasoning', it routes to Gemini 3 Pro. If it is 'Simulation', it routes to Gemini 3 Flash. If it is 'Conversational', it established a link with Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio for sub-200ms latency. This unified ecosystem ensures perfect consistency across the spectrum. We do not use third-party models like BERT or GPT; we believe in the native multimodal depth of the Gemini ecosystem." },
          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "We have bypassed traditional 'LLM wrappers' by building our own refractive snapshot protocol that bundles code deltas directly into the neural session. This ensures the AI always has perfect visibility of your active workspace." }

          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "Consistency is the greatest challenge in distributed intelligence. We solve this using Deterministic UUIDs. We hash the topic, context, and language to create a permanent address for every synthesized artifact." },

By using gemini-3-flash-preview to trace logic heuristically, we bypass the provision/compile/teardown cycle entirely." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Does the simulation achieve true parity with native GCC or Python runtimes?" },
          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "In our internal algorithmic audits, we achieved >98% parity for standard technical interview tasks. We utilize the model's latent understanding of POSIX specifications. This results in a 10x energy efficiency gain per execution, as the logic is processed as a pure inference task rather than a physical CPU instruction set. We are essentially predicting the outcome of the program rather than executing it physically." }
