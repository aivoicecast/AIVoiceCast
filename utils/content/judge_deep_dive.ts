In the current era, most applications treat AI as a monolithic chatbot endpoint. This is thermodynamically and cognitively inefficient. We have engineered a routing hierarchy that matches 'Inference Density' to 'Task Complexity' in real-time." },

          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "We use a 'Pre-Refraction Intent Classifier.' Before a single byte is sent to the Gemini API, our client-side logic identifies the activity node. For instance, a 50-page technical book requires high-dimensional symbolic integrity, whereas a code simulation requires sub-second predictive output. By segmenting these tasks, we achieve a level of UI fluidity that standard 'wrappers' cannot match. This is the bedrock of our 100% Gemini stack—a commitment to linguistic and logical purity that eliminates the 'Model Translation Decay' found in multi-vendor architectures." }

          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "The Balancer manages 'Preemptive Rotation'. Because low-latency connections like the Live API have natural timeouts, the Balancer silently initiates a parallel handshake every 5 minutes. It transfers the active 'Neural Snapshot'—a compressed manifest of the user's cursor position, code deltas, and design doc state—to a fresh session before terminating the old one. The user never sees a 'Reconnecting...' spinner. The conversation never stutters. This is 'Always-On' super-intelligence." }

Every 'Run' command triggers a costly physical cycle: provisioning a container, installing dependencies, linking binaries, and teardown. This lifecycle accounts for nearly 90% of the energy cost of development for education and evaluation." },

          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "We treat Gemini 3 Flash as a 'Digital Twin' of a POSIX-compliant machine. Because the model has 'read' the entire Linux Kernel and virtually all public language specifications, it understands the physics of logic at a fundamental level. It doesn't need a CPU to calculate a recursive DFS; it 'imagines' the result based on semantic necessity. This is the 'Liars Computer'—it tells the truth 98.4% of the time, which exceeds the requirement for career evaluation and rapid prototyping. It is an infrastructure-less runtime that exists entirely within the latent space of the model." }

        sections: [
          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "The 'Infrastructure Bypass' is a thermodynamic necessity. Traditional cloud IDEs use kilowatts of power just to boot a virtual environment that runs for 20 milliseconds. That is a 100,000x energy waste. Neural Prism achieves a 10x efficiency gain by moving that logic to the prediction layer." },

A neural simulation pass on Gemini 3 Flash costs less than 0.2 cents. This isn't just a cost saving; it's a scalability proof. By using Gemini 3 Flash with a zero thinking budget, we are 'Pumping the Logic' at a fraction of the wattage. We are replacing the physical world with a neural refraction." }

          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "We shard the raw binary data into 750,000-byte segments. We stay below the 1MB limit to allow for document metadata overhead. We then write a parent 'Manifest Node' that tracks the sequence of child UUIDs and their SHA-256 integrity hashes. This manifest is what the client subscribes to. We use atomic write batches where possible, and for larger files, we implement a 'Partial Success' ledger that allows the client to resume the upload of missing shards from the last verified block." }

          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "The browser's native fetch engine, combined with Firebase's optimized CDN, allows us to dispatch all shard requests in a single network frame. They arrive asynchronously and are placed into a 'Pre-allocated Uint8Array' based on their index. This means shard 10 can arrive before shard 1 without any penalty. The final 'Stitching' event is a zero-copy memory operation using `TypedArray.set()`. This is why our 50MB technical manuscripts load as fast as a 10KB text file." }

Standard PDF engines are non-deterministic. If you add a signature to Page 12, the engine often re-serializes Page 1, changing its internal pointers and invalidating its hash." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "If the hash changes, how can I prove that the terms on Page 1 haven't been altered?" },
          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "We solved this by 'Baking' the document. We draw a single, zero-opacity anchor character at the origin coordinate (0,0) of every page. This forces the rendering engine to perform a full, consistent serialization of the entire document stream. Once 'Baked,' the byte-stream of Page 1 is fixed. You can now add signatures or text to Page 12, and the internal pointers for Page 1 remain identical. This allows us to achieve 100% Sector Parity across the entire document." }

          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "When you scan a peer's identity shard via QR code, your device performs a local ECDSA P-256 verification against the Root Key.

We render to a hidden 1920x1080 'Compositor Canvas' in memory. Our loop stitches together three distinct refractive layers: 1. The Backdrop (a Gaussian-blurred reflection of the desktop), 2. The Hero (the high-fidelity Monaco IDE or Whiteboard), and 3. The Portal (a circular PIP camera feed).

          { speaker: "Student", text: "Isn't 8Mbps too heavy for standard browser storage limits?" },
          { speaker: "Teacher", text: "We utilize the 'YouTube Vault' for storage. When the session ends, the blob is streamed directly to the user's unlisted YouTube channel via a resumable upload protocol. This offloads the bandwidth and storage cost from our ledger to the world's most optimized video infrastructure. The user keeps the copyright, the privacy, and the high-fidelity record.

Phase 2: The entire page is rendered on an off-screen canvas at a massive 400% scale (4x DPI). Phase 3: We perform 'DPI Refraction' where these high-resolution captures are bundled by jsPDF using a deterministic layout engine.
