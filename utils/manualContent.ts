# ✍️ Neural Scribe: The Resilient Socratic Record

**Refracting Speech into Permanent Technical Artifacts.**

The Scribe Studio is a high-fidelity audio-to-markdown transcription engine engineered for architectural sessions.

## 🛠️ The Integrity Manifesto (v9.9.2)

During the development of the Scribe Protocol, we encountered several "Neural Drift" challenges. Here are the architectural decisions we made to ensure 100% data integrity.

### 1. The Formatting Paradox (The "Hang" Issue)
**Problem**: In early versions, we asked the AI model to handle paragraph breaks and newlines in real-time. This caused the model to frequently "freeze" or stop outputting text entirely while it "thought" about where to place a break.
**Final Decision**: We have stripped all formatting logic from the AI's system prompt. The model now acts as a **Zero-Format Verbatim Mirror**. It focuses purely on mirroring your speech at maximum speed, preventing stream halts.

### 2. Temporal Gap Paragraphing
**Problem**: Without breaks, the resulting transcript was a "Wall of Text," impossible to read or synthesize professionally.
**Final Decision**: We offloaded formatting to the **Client-Side Refraction Engine**. The Studio monitors the timing of your speech. If it detects a gap greater than 2.5 seconds, it automatically injects a double newline (\`\\n\\n\`). This provides structural clarity without confusing the AI model.

### 3. The 503 Congestion Protocol (Vault-First)
**Problem**: Heavy AI models occasionally return a "503: Service Overloaded" error during the intensive summary generation phase. In standard apps, this results in the total loss of the transcript.
**Final Decision**: We implement **Pre-emptive Vault Commitment**. The moment you click "Terminate," the raw transcript is notarized and saved to your **Sovereign Vault** (Documents) with a unique UUID. 
- Even if the synthesis engine is overloaded, your data is already safe.
- You can trigger "Retry Synthesis" manually at any time once the model congestion clears.

### 4. Heuristic Recovery (Interim Audit)
**Problem**: Network jitter can sometimes cause a delta between the raw Stt (Speech-to-Text) fragments and the AI's mirrored stream.
**Final Decision**: At the end of every session, the Studio performs a **Parity Audit**. It compares the length of the AI stream against the raw interim text buffer. If the AI stream lagged behind, the system uses the raw buffer as the source of truth to ensure not a single word of your session is lost.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Sovereign VFS**: Direct dispatch to your Google Drive or technicalspec.md.
- **Low-Mass Mode**: Minimalist interface for maximum cognitive focus.
- **One-Click Synthesis**: Refract hours of dialogue into a 3-paragraph executive brief.

# 🔭 Neural Lens: Intelligence Observability

**Mission Control for Automated Reasoning Verification.**

The Neural Lens is the primary instrumentation tool for ensuring technical truth. It turns the "Liar's Computer" into a verifiable system of record.

### 🛠️ How to use the Lens:

#### 1. Ingest/Generate Content
The Lens operates on "Nodes" (Lectures, Documents, Specifications). To trigger an audit, go to the **Hub (Discovery)** or **Author Studio** and generate a new technical dialogue. 

#### 2. The Shadow Audit (Automatic)
Upon generation, the **Shadow Agent** (Gemini 3 Pro) recursively analyzes the content to extract logic gates and dependency concepts.

#### 3. Inspect the Logic Mesh
Open the **Neural Lens** app from the launcher. Use the sidebar to select your generated node. 
- **The Graph**: View how the AI has linked technical concepts (e.g., how "Buddy Allocator" links to "Memory Fragmentation").
- **Structural Coherence**: Check the score (0-100). Scores below 80 indicate potential "Neural Drift" where the logic may be shallow.

#### 4. Review Adversarial Probes
The most critical part of the audit is the **Adversarial Trace**. Here, you see the questions the Shadow Agent used to challenge the Lead Agent's reasoning.
- **Passed**: The logic held up under scrutiny.
- **Warning**: A logical contradiction was detected. You should trigger a "Neural Refraction" (Refresh button) to repair the node.

### 💎 Pro-Tip for Judges:
Select the **🏆 JUDGE: Technical Audit** node in the Lens sidebar to see how the platform evaluates its own architecture against the hackathon criteria.
