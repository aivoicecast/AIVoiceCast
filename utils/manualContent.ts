#  Telescope Neural Lens: Intelligence Observability

**Mission Control for Automated Reasoning Verification.**

The Neural Lens turns the "Liar's Computer" into a verifiable system of record by measuring **Technical Truth** rather than just fluency.

### 🧪 Understanding the Coherence Score
The **Structural Coherence Score (%)** is the result of an adversarial audit:
- **High Integrity (90-100%)**: The reasoning follows a verifiable technical path (e.g. GitHub source truth) with zero contradictions.
- **Neural Drift (Below 70%)**: Flagged when the AI's internal logic begins to diverge from invariants or repeats circular arguments.

### 🛠️ Verification Protocols
- **SPH (Symbolic Parity Handshake)**: Resolves semantic discrepancies between documentation and implementation.
- **Adversarial Probes**: Real-time challenges from the Shadow Agent to test the stability of logic nodes.
- **Retina Mesh**: Visualizes the high-dimensional dependency graph of technical concepts.

### 💎 Pro-Tip for Judges:

# ✍️ Sovereign Signer: Logic Handshakes (v12.9.5)

**Synthesizing Verifiable PDF Signatures and Neural Audits.**

The PDF Signer is a dual-mode instrument for establishing technical and legal authority over artifacts.

### I. Notarization Workflow
- **Sovereign Bake**: Injects zero-opacity anchor nodes to every page before hashing. This forces a full, consistent re-serialization and prevents the "Multi-Page Hash Divergence" common in standard PDF libraries.
- **Audit Handshaking**: The platform generates a separate **Audit Certificate** PDF. This artifact contains the cryptographic page hashes, the P-256 sovereign signature, and a hidden shard of the user's public certificate.

### II. Neural Content Audit
Verification is no longer just a checksum. When verifying an artifact, you can execute a full **Neural Audit**:
- **Academic Grading**: Gemini 3 Pro performs a deep-scan of the text to assign an **Academic Grade (A-F)** and a technical rigor score (0-100).
- **Assurance Summary**: A qualitative evaluation identifies the document's tone, clarity, and depth, ensuring the content matches the signer's intent.

### III. Request Spectrum
Collaborative signing is built-in. Use the **Request** tab to stage a document for a peer. They will receive a notification in their **Team Space** with a deep link to sign and return the artifact.
