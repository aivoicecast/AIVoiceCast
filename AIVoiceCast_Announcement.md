# Welcome to AIVoiceCast v4.3.0: The Verified Ledger Edition

**By Admin** | *Posted in Platform Updates*

The era of passive listening is over. Traditional podcasts are great for consumption, but AIVoiceCast transforms consumption into creation. With the release of **v4.3.0**, we have focused on **Verified Technical Evaluations** and **Ledger Continuity**.

## What's New in v4.3.0?

### 1. 🛡️ Verified Technical Ledger
The Mock Interview system is now strictly atomic. 
*   **Persistent Evaluations:** Every coding, system design, or behavioral interview is archived to the cloud ledger.
*   **Global Discovery:** Explore public evaluations from top candidates across the community to learn standard-setting technical answers.

### 2. 🧠 Neural Link Resilience
The Live Studio now supports meetings of unlimited length.
*   **Neural Rotation:** Every 5 minutes, the system silently refreshes your connection to the AI to prevent infrastructure timeouts.
*   **Context Continuity:** The AI "remembers" the recent conversation across these refreshes, ensuring a seamless flow even during hour-long recorded sessions.

### 3. 📂 Code Studio with Google Drive & Cloud Integration
The Code Studio has been completely re-architected to serve as your primary cloud IDE.
*   **Google Drive Integration:** Open, edit, and save code files residing in your Drive without leaving the app.
*   **Private Cloud Storage:** Persistent storage for complex projects and assets.

### 4. 💼 The Career Center
We believe learning should lead to earning.
